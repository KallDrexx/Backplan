Backplan
========

**This application is currently in early development**

Backplan is meant to be an open source solution for secure backups on site and off site.  The plan is for the Backplan client to watch directories for changes, upload those changes to a Backplan server (without file shares to prevent ransomware from corrupting backups), and allowing Backplan servers to auto-replicate to each other, as well as cloud services such as Amazon Glacier.
